# Getting Started with Create React App

Tried to make as intuitive solution as possible with as minimum amount of code/time as possible. MVP.

For code structural efficiency: brokekdown elements into smaller components. With re-uasable components, HOC, hooks and passsing memory using context.  


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install` on latest node version !    
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
